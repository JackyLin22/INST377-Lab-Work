    <h1 >Jacky Lin Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

    <h2>First, the basics.</h2>

    <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>My top 5 favorite music albums.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Happiness Begins by Jonas Brothers</li>
        <li>V by Maroon 5</li>
        <li>18 Months by Calvin Harris</li>

    </ol>
    
    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

    <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>

    <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>

    <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

    <h3>Empty Elements</h3>

    Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br>
    Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br>
    Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

    <h2>Mochi Images</h2>

    <p>Alt text for the images are useful for accessibility.</p>
    <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width = "75" alt="Happy face with a bubble">
    <img src="images/mochi.png" width = "75" alt="Happy face">
    <img src="images/mochi.svg" alt="Face with vectors">
    <img src="images/mochi.gif" width = "75" alt="Smiling and bouncing face">
    <p>These 4 Mochi images are fun and creative.</p>
